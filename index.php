					<!-- Two column text format -->

					<p>
						
						I'm originally from Seattle, WA, and just moved back from Wellington, New Zealand. I
						graduated in May from Grinnell College with a
						degree in General Science: Computer Science, and a
						concentration in Neuroscience. I've spent my summers
						working with at-risk youth, doing art in the park with
						kids in Iowa, and building websites for community non-
						profits.

					</p>

					<p>

						I like a lot of different things (like art, kids, and rolling around outdoors), so my approach
						to projects reflects that. With the natural
						relationship between the web and photography, I think it's
						valuable to have experience in both.

			The old RAYS site didn't have a lot of appeal. It had little
			in the way of personalized content that was at all relevant to the
			work they actually <em>do</em>. For an organization that does a large
			portion of its work from referrals, and relies on individual
			donors, this was less than ideal.

		</p>

		<p>

			Starting from scratch, I worked with RAYS staff to build
			a site filled with both <em>more</em> and more relevant
			descriptions of the work they do and the people they affect.
			Building better emotional connections with visitors to their site
			should allow them to foster more online donations, and become
			better known within the community. To this end I interviewed
			staff, collected stories of clients, wrote stories of clients,
			poured through grant applications, and took photos at events, of
			staff, and around their offices. This is alongside the technical
			aspects of making a site backed by a new content management system
			that's easier for staff to work with, so it can be updated more
			regularly by more people.

			What do you do with a guest house? Rent it out. To this end, the
			owners of this particular guest house on Bainbridge Island wanted
			a website which would allow them to promote their property, and
			offer an convenient solution for online booking and payment. The
			site needed to be aesthetically and organizationally inline with
			the idea of a modern island cottage, while emphasizing its idyllic setting.

		</p>

		<p>

			Part of the project included photographing the interior and
			exterior of the guest house. Good imagery was identified as
			extremely important to attracting new guests, and so much of my
			time was spent carefully documenting the space and editing the
			resulting photos. Additionally, the site was setup with WordPress on the backend
			to enable the owners to easily add to these images over time (alongside
			being able to add other new content, like guest comments and updated activity lists).

				<h3 class="clean-subheader">Grinnell Localfoods Coop</h3>
				<h4><em>User Interaction Designer, Fall 2012 - Spring 2013</em></h4>
				
				<section class="two-column text-cols--2">
					<p>

						The Grinnell Localfoods Coop needed a new site, and new
						functionality. For producers, managing their inventory on
						the old site was a mess, and for users, buying was an
						exercise in wading through unorganized lists of only semi-
						relevant text, and lacking payment options. Starting from
						scratch a small team of us set out to build something
						better, working with Localfoods coordinators all along the
						way to make sure we were adhering to their needs.

					</p>
					<p>

						The primary goals of the project were to allow producers
						to more effectively manage their goods, and for users to
						be able to pay for their purchases online. As the UI guy,
						I was nominally in charge of all front-facing aspects of
						the site. This included the layouts of pages, navigation,
						graphics and photography, cross browser/platform testing,
						user testing, and making the whole thing responsive for
						devices of all sizes.

					</p>
					<p>

						It's all currently being prepped for deployment, but
						you can visit the shakey development server
						temporarily <a
						href="http://fulkerson.cs.grinnell.edu" target="_blank">here</a>.
